# WolfHacks Backend

Minimal FastAPI server for the WolfHacks frontend.

## Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Check it's alive:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
```

Applications are submitted as JSON to `POST /api/applications` and appended to the configured Google Sheet. Create an `Applications` worksheet with this header row:

### Day-of check-in

Organizer-facing endpoints for confirming a registrant at the door, backed by
the `checked_in` / `checked_in_at` columns in Supabase (see
`supabase_schema.sql`). Search and check-in require a Supabase session
belonging to a participant with `role` set to `organizer` or `admin` (the
same `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` auth as the rest of the portal;
see `auth.get_current_participant` and `require_organizer` in `main.py`):

- `GET /api/checkin/search?q=...` — searches by email (exact, case-insensitive)
  if `q` contains `@`, otherwise by name. Returns matching registrants,
  including `accepted` (the admission decision, set separately from
  check-in -- organizers flip it in the Supabase table editor) so staff can
  see at a glance whether a registrant was actually accepted into the
  event. This does not gate check-in; a rejected applicant who shows up is
  flagged, not blocked.
- `POST /api/checkin/{id}` — marks a registrant checked in.
- `GET /api/checkin/verify?email=...` — unauthenticated, returns
  `{"checked_in": true|false}` only. This is the hook the day-of portal's
  login should call: a registrant who submitted an application but was never
  checked in at the event must not be able to log in.

Create a Google Cloud service account, enable the Google Sheets API, download
its JSON key, and share the spreadsheet with the service account email as an
Editor. Keep the JSON key outside version control.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values — `.env` is gitignored
and loaded automatically on startup:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```dotenv
# Google Sheets
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=C:\secrets\wolfhacks-sheets.json
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=1ckYK82T8wayiCLtluOkQek4gQ4lwwE2WEvyWRLR6I3M
GOOGLE_SHEETS_RANGE=Applications!A:X

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=<anon-or-publishable-key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service-role-key>

# App
WOLFHACKS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
WOLFHACKS_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

The default CORS origins are the local Vite URLs. The API never sends Google
or Supabase credentials to the browser. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` bypasses
row-level security — only ever use it server-side, never in frontend code.

## Deploying on Vercel

This repo deploys as a single Vercel project using [Services](https://vercel.com/docs/services):
the Vite frontend and this FastAPI backend build and deploy together, on one
domain, with `/api/*` routed to the backend (see `vercel.json` at the repo root).

Because the backend has no persistent filesystem in a deployed function, it
can't read a service-account key from a local file path. Instead, set
`GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` in the Vercel project's environment variables to
the **full contents** of the service-account JSON key file (paste the whole
JSON object as the value). `main.py` checks `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`
first and only falls back to `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` when it's unset, so
local dev (which still uses a file on disk) is unaffected.

Also set `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID` (and `GOOGLE_SHEETS_RANGE` if it
differs from the default) in the same place. `WOLFHACKS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
generally isn't needed in production — the frontend calls `/api/...` as a
relative path, so requests are same-origin and never trigger CORS.

## Team dashboard (issue #4)

`teams.py` adds the endpoints behind the `/team` page in the frontend, gated
by the same `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` auth as the rest of the
portal (see `auth.get_current_participant`). Persistence is **Supabase
Postgres** (`repository.py`) — team identity is the existing `applications`
table (the columns `checked_in`, `user_id`, `discord_id`, `role` come from
the check-in and login features; this module reads them and never writes
them). There is no separate `participants` table.

Team tables (`teams`, `team_members`, `team_invites`), the
`participant_directory` view, and the `accept_team_invite` /
`leave_team_tx` / `search_available_participants` functions live in
`backend/supabase_schema.sql` alongside everything else — run that file in
the Supabase SQL editor, then `seed_dev_data.sql` for local test data. See
`docs/testing-team-dashboard.md` for the full walkthrough.

Seeded accounts (`backend/seed_dev_data.sql`): `jordan@ncsu.edu` leads
"Wolfpack Coders", `taylor@ncsu.edu` is a member, `alex@ncsu.edu` has a
pending invite, `sam@ncsu.edu` / `morgan@ncsu.edu` are checked in with no
team, `casey@ncsu.edu` is registered but not checked in.

Live updates on `/team` are done by the frontend polling `GET /api/team/me`
every ~10s, not Supabase Realtime — see plan.md Phase 4 for why.

**Responsiveness pass:** testing against a real dev project surfaced two
problems, both fixed. First, a real bug — `useTeamState.js`'s staleness
guard didn't invalidate in-flight requests on logout, so a slow response
from a just-logged-out session could briefly render under the next person's
login; fixed by bumping its sequence counter unconditionally. Second, every
action felt sluggish because of sheer round-trip count: each Supabase call
built a brand-new client (repeated TLS handshakes), and four mutating
endpoints fetched the *entire* team state just to check who the leader was.
`repository.py` now reuses one client for the process lifetime (via
`db.get_supabase_client()`) and exposes `get_team_role()`, a 2-query
leadership check, in place of that. The frontend mirrors this: every
mutation (create, invite, accept, decline, cancel, leave, track/challenge
changes) now applies the backend's own response directly to local state
instead of triggering a second full refetch — see `useTeamState.js`'s
`setTeam`/`setIncomingInvites`/`setOutgoingInvites`, which are
identity-guarded so a mutation response can't reopen the same cross-session
staleness bug through a different path.

Endpoints: `GET /api/team/me`,
`POST /api/teams`, `PATCH /api/teams/{id}`,
`DELETE /api/teams/{id}/members/me`, `POST /api/teams/{id}/invites`
(body `{"email": ...}` -- exact match against a checked-in hacker; there is
deliberately no participant search, so emails can't be browsed),
`DELETE /api/teams/{id}/invites/{invite_id}`, `POST /api/invites/{id}/accept`,
`POST /api/invites/{id}/decline` — all authenticated the same way as the
rest of the portal.
