// Single source of truth for the portal's nav tabs. Each feature branch
// (team dashboard, live schedule, announcements) replaces its section's
// placeholder card in PortalShell with the real page -- the id/path/label
// here is what wires it into the shell's nav. A hacker's own check-in status
// isn't a tab -- it's shown as a badge in the header instead (see
// PortalShell.jsx). `organizerOnly` hides a tab from the nav for non-
// organizers; `hackerOnly` does the reverse (organizers don't need a team to
// hack on). Both CheckInSection and TeamDashboard also gate their own
// content as defense in depth against someone hitting the URL directly.
