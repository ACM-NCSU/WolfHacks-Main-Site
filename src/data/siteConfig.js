          question: 'What is a hackathon, and why should I participate?',
          answer:
            "A hackathon is an invention marathon. Students team up to build a software or hardware project over 24 hours, from a blank slate to a working demo. It's very beginner friendly; you don't need to have hackathon experience, and there's no illegal or malicious hacking involved. You'll build something real in a weekend, learn skills that don't fit in a classroom, and meet people who like building things as much as you do. There are mentors and workshops if you want to learn something new, and it looks great on a resume even if you've never coded before.",
        },
        {
          question: 'How much does it cost?',
          answer: "Nothing. Attending WolfHacks is free, including meals for the weekend. We'll also have prizes for the winners.",

        {
          question: 'Do I need to be a student to attend?',

            'No. Anyone over the age of 18 is eligible to attend, whether or not you are a university student.',
        },
        {
          question: 'Do I need a team, or experience, to apply?',
          answer:
            "No to both. You can apply solo and form a team at the event, and total beginners are welcome — there will be workshops and mentors all weekend. Teams should be between 2 and 4 people, and we'll have a team-building activity right after opening ceremony if you'd like to find teammates.",
