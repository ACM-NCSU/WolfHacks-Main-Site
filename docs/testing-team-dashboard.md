# Testing the Team Dashboard (#4)

Branch: `feature/team-dashboard` ([PR #8](https://github.com/ACM-NCSU/WolfHacks-Day-Of-Portal/pull/8))

## Setup

This now runs against a real Postgres database. The team tables
(`teams`/`team_members`/`team_invites`, the `participant_directory` view, and
the `accept_team_invite`/`leave_team_tx`/`search_available_participants`
functions) used to live only in `backend/supabase_dev_bootstrap.sql`, marked
dev-only and never applied to the shared production project -- which is why
`GET /api/team/me` 500'd there. That schema is now folded into
`backend/supabase_schema.sql` (the real source of truth); the dev bootstrap
script is retired.

1. Create a dev Supabase project (or reuse one you already made for this),
   or use the shared project if you have access.
2. In its SQL editor, run `backend/supabase_schema.sql`, then
   `backend/seed_dev_data.sql`.
3. Fill in `backend/.env` with that project's `SUPABASE_URL` and
   `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (Project Settings → API).

```bash
git pull
npm install

cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # skip if the venv already exists
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

In a second terminal, from the repo root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173/team**.

**To reset back to the seed state** at any point, re-run
`backend/seed_dev_data.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor — it deletes and
recreates the six accounts and the one seed team.

## Logging in

Portal login is real Supabase auth now: Discord OAuth for hackers,
email/password for organizers (self-serve password setup was removed --
it was an unauthenticated endpoint that handed back a working login link for
any registered email, so organizer passwords are set directly in the
Supabase dashboard instead). The seeded accounts below have no password and
no linked Discord identity, so you can't log into them through the UI as-is
-- use `VITE_SKIP_AUTH`/`VITE_SKIP_AUTH_ROLE` in `.env` to exercise the team
dashboard as one of them locally, or link a real Discord account to a seeded
row's `discord_id` by hand for an end-to-end login test. These accounts are
pre-seeded:

| Email | State |
|---|---|
| `jordan@ncsu.edu` | leader of "Wolfpack Coders" |
| `taylor@ncsu.edu` | member of "Wolfpack Coders" |
| `alex@ncsu.edu` | has a pending invite to "Wolfpack Coders" |
| `sam@ncsu.edu` | checked in, no team |
| `morgan@ncsu.edu` | checked in, no team (invite target) |
| `casey@ncsu.edu` | not checked in — should be blocked from logging in |
| anything else | not registered — should show that message |

At **http://localhost:5173/portal/login**, click "Set up your password",
enter one of the emails above, and open the `debug_link` from the backend's
response (or the network tab) to set a password, then log in normally.

Ids are real Postgres uuids; if you're hitting the API directly with curl,
grab ids from `backend/seed_dev_data.sql` or a `GET /api/team/me` response.

## Things to try

- Log in as `jordan` → create/view team, set a track + challenges, invite `sam` or `morgan` by searching their name/email.
- Log out, log in as the person you invited → accept the invite, confirm you're now on the team.
- Log back in as `jordan` → confirm the roster updated.
- Leave the team as `jordan` (leader) → confirm leadership transfers to `taylor`, not deleted.
- Try `casey` and a random email → confirm the login error messages make sense.
- Toggle light/dark mode while on `/team`.
- Try to break it: invite someone already on a team, fill a team to 4 and try a 5th, submit a blank team name, refresh mid-flow.
- **Restart `uvicorn` mid-walkthrough** — the team should still be there. That's the whole point of this phase.
- Open `/team` in two browser profiles (or one normal + one incognito), log in as two different people, and send an invite from one — it should show up in the other within about 10 seconds without touching anything (polling, not a manual refresh). Watch the Network tab: one `/api/team/me` request every 10s, and none while the tab is backgrounded.
- **Every action should feel instant, in one network request.** Watch the Network tab while creating a team, inviting, accepting, declining, canceling, leaving, and changing track/challenges — each should fire exactly one request and update the screen the moment it resolves, not two requests with a pause between them.
- **Cross-session check** (this is a real bug that was fixed, not a hypothetical): throttle the network (DevTools → Slow 3G), start an action (e.g. leave a team) as one person, and *before* it finishes, log out and log in as someone else. The new person must never briefly see the previous person's data.

If you accidentally create a team with a wrong/junk name while testing (e.g.
pasting the wrong thing into the "team name" field), just leave it — leaving
an empty team deletes it — rather than leaving stray teams in the database.
A team you can't get back into any other way can be deleted directly in the
Supabase table editor (`teams` table), which cascades to its members/invites.

## Known limitations (not bugs)

- Live updates are polling-based (every ~10s), not instant — see plan.md Phase 4 for why Realtime was deliberately skipped this round.
